Stripped down old project down to just the matching engine
I have to think of this conceptually, what are my goals?
Ultimately I want to start from a very concrete and simple base and build from there
but I am not sure what features or functions I am to implement

Basically this is a trading simulator designed to help familiarize me with not only data structures
but systems design and industry benchmarking practices
So I must have input -> matching engine -> output, so I am thinking we can break this into some sort of FSM

I've fully implemented the AddOrder part of this matching engine. To do this i researched a lot about
2 STL Functions/Objects: Visit and Variant.
Variant: Basically just a container for different types
Visit: Pick how to run code depending on what variable type we look at within variant
